## What is this?

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb64dc93-37e7-421f-bc5d-89a8ef43b7c8

A UserScript for mouse and trackpad users, aiming to replicate Microsoft Edge's built-in text selection toolbar. It enables quick copy, search, and other operations on selected text without repeatedly opening the right-click context menu.

## How to Install?

It is recommended to install from [👉**Greasy Fork**👈](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/558720) for automatic updates. Alternatively, download from [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/CodebyGPT/word_selection_toolbar/releases) and import manually into your script manager.

> If this is your first time installing a UserScript, you must first install a script manager in your browser: Chromium 138+ recommended: [ScriptCat](https://docs.scriptcat.org/); older Chromium and Firefox browsers recommended: [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), [Legacy ScriptCat (v0.16.x)](https://github.com/scriptscat/scriptcat/releases/tag/v0.16.11).

## Basic Features

* Toolbar UI inspired by Apple Inc.'s Liquid Glass style (future plans: hover highlights, click-bounce effects cross-browser, lens refraction via CSS and SVG filters for Chromium-based browsers)
* Multi-language support (machine-translated)
* Low memory footprint
* 100% event-driven
* Runs in an isolated context, makes no modifications to the webpage by default — does not affect normal page operation
* 100% offline (script auto-updates are handled by the script manager reading metadata)
* No obfuscated code
* Built according to the latest [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) for maximum compatibility
